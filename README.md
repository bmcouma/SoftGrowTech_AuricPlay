## 🚀 Quick Start

AuricPlay is incredibly easy to set up. It requires no backend, no databases, and no complex build tools.

### 1. Add Your Music
1. Place any `.mp3` files into the `assets/music/` folder.
2. (Optional) Place corresponding cover art into the `assets/images/` folder.
3. Update the `LOCAL_TRACKS` array in `js/api.js` to reference your specific filenames.

### 2. Run the App
**Option A: Direct Open (Simplest)**
Double-click `index.html` to open it directly in any modern web browser.

**Option B: Local Preview Server (Recommended for Audio Visuals)**
Run a lightweight local server from the project root directory. *Note: This project contains no backend; this server simply allows the browser to bypass local file restrictions for the Audio Visualizer and Crossfading.*
```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8080

# Node.js
npx serve .
```
Then visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.
